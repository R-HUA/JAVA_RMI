## Distributed White Board
* Develop a white board that can be shared between multiple users over the network.
* The system must be implemented in Java but you can choose the technology you want to use to build your distributed application.

### Requirements – Basic Features
#### Whiteboard – Multiuser system
 Multiple users can draw on a shared interactive canvas.
 Your system will support a single whiteboard that is shared between all 
of the clients. 
 Key Elements with GUI 
 Shapes: at least your white board should support for line, circle, triangle and rectangle.

##### Comments
Dear Student, Thanks for the submission of this assignment. Overall your submission is very good. 
Application is user friendly and the concurrency handling is done properly with low delay for syncing the content. Improvements are required for graceful exit handling.(-1)
Advanced Features : Can be improved to increase user friendliness (-1.25)
Report : The report can be better structured to highlight more on implementation & distributed computing concepts, protocols and messaging. (-1)
